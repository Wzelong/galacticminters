# GalacticMinters Project Proposal

Galactic Minters is a decentralized web application that combines elements of exploration, resource management, and crafting of unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Set in a vast, procedurally generated galaxy, players embark on a journey to discover new planets, gather precious resources, and craft one-of-a-kind energy cores, known as Galactic Cubes. These cubes, each with their unique appearance, are remnants of an ancient galactic civilization and can be installed in spaceships to enhance their capabilities. Players can trade Galactic Cubes in the game’s marketplace, adding real-world value to these digital assets.

## Objective

The primary objective of Galactic Minters is to provide an immersive and engaging gaming experience where players can explore, collaborate, and trade while crafting rare and valuable NFTs in the form of Galactic Cubes. By leveraging blockchain technology, the game aims to create a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform for players to interact, trade, and showcase their unique creations.

## Game Mechanics

- Planet Generation: After signing up, each player is assigned a unique planet, complete with exclusive resources.
- Exploration: Players explore the universe to discover new planets and gather information about other players’ resources. Travel time between planets is determined by distance and spaceship capabilities.
- Resource Exchange: Players can send and receive resource exchange requests with others, facilitating collaboration and fostering a sense of community.
- Time-Limited Recipes: Periodically, the game will release time-limited crafting recipes. Players must gather the required resources to create unique Galactic Cubes before the recipe expires.
- Crafting: Players can craft Galactic Cubes using their resources or exchanging them with others. Cube appearances are generated through a material-mixing algorithm, ensuring variation in color, texture, and some rarely appeared symbols.
- Spaceship Integration: Players can install their crafted Galactic Cubes into their spaceships, enhancing their capabilities, such as faster travel or improved cargo capacity.
- Marketplace: Players can trade their crafted Galactic Cubes in the game’s marketplace. Each cube’s scarcity, uniqueness, and utility contribute to its value.
